RED
First test to work out if we initialize the word correctly

 def test_init(self):
        game  = darts.scoreboard()

GREEN
To make this test green we need at least the following

class scoreboard:
    """ Implements a score board for a darts game """
    pass

RED
What do we want to do with the class. It is a two player class. We
want to know the score of player 1 and the score of player 2.

We assume that we are playing pub darts and start at 301. Games take
to long otherwise and it takes time away from beer.

 def test_score(self):
        game  = darts()
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301)


This fails

AttributeError: 'scoreboard' object has no attribute 'playerscore'

GREEN
class scoreboard:
    """ Implements a score board for a darts game """
    def __init__(self):
        self.playerscores = [301,301]
    def playerscore(self,player):
        return(self.playerscores[player-1])


RED 
We only want two players. We want an exception thrown if we ask for
the score of another player.

 def test_exception(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        self.assertRaises(NameError, game.playerscore,3)


GREEN

    def playerscore(self,player):
        if player == 1 or player == 2:
            return(self.playerscores[player-1])
        else:
            raise NameError('player out of range')

RED
A darts board is divided into 20 regions. In each region you can score
a single or double or triple times the score. So we want players to
enter their score.

    def test_scoring(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',15)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-15)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-15-2*20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-15-2*20-3*5)

The test is going to fail. We do not have a playerthrown method.

Still RED
Well I corrected the code and I still got it wrong.
    def playerthrown(player,multiplier,number):
        if multiplier == 'double':
            number = number*2
        elif multiplier == 'triple':
            number = number*3
        self.playerscores[player-1] += number

I got the error
 TypeError: playerthrown() takes exactly 3 positional arguments (4
 given)

I'm still new to Python. I forgot self in the method.

At least now it runs but I still get an error.
    self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-15)
   AssertionError: 316 != 286

Did I get the code or the test wrong. The test looks fine, but I want
to isolate things. I'll reorganize  the tests.

    def test_scoring_single(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',15)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-15)
    def test_scoring_double(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-(2*20))
    def test_scoring_triple(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-(3*5))

All three tests fail

Looking at the code, I have made a stupid error.
     self.playerscores[player-1] += number
should be
     self.playerscores[player-1] -= number


Now finally all the tests fail.

RED
 Darts is a two player game. First player 1 plays 3 shots then player
 two plays three shots. We have to decide how the object behaves if
 players play out of turn. We'll throw exceptions. There are other
 ways of doing this, but ***now*** is the time to decide. Write the
 tests to capture the behaviour  that you want. 

def test_player_1_plays_first(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        #If a player 2 plays before player 1 then raise an exception.
        self.assertRaises(NameError, game.playerthrown,2,'single',5)

Of course this test fails.

GREEN
 To solve this problem we need a variable that keeps track of the
 state of who's turn it is.

So we modify the __init__ method.

 def __init__(self):
        self.playerscores = [301,301]
        self.turn = 1
and modify the playerthwon method.

So we add the code:
    def playerthrown(self,player,multiplier,number):
        if player != turn:
            raise NameError('throw out of turn')
        .....

Ooops again, I'm new to Python. The test failed.
  NameError: global name 'turn' is not defined

Forgot to use use self.turn easy to correct and now all the test pass.

RED
 Now we have to think about how the game works. 
 You make 3 throws and then it is the other players turn.

 Since we are using exceptions we expect the following code to be
 exception free.

def test_three_throws(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)

We run the tests and get an exception when player two tries to throw a
dart.

GREEN
 So we need to keep track of how many throws have been. If we get to 3
 then it is the other players turn.

Modify __init__
 def __init__(self):
        self.playerscores = [301,301]
        self.turn = 1
        self.throws = 0

and modify playerthrown to keep track of how many throws and flip the
player when there have been 3 throws.

  def playerthrown(self,player,multiplier,number):
        if player != self.turn:
            raise NameError('throw out of turn')
        self.throws = self.throws + 1
        if (self.throws == 3):
            self.turn = 1 - self.turn

Mmm the tests still fail.

Ah, I'm stupid. I have a problem with indexing players both by 1 and
by 0. This is going cause more errors in the future. From now on I
will always index the players by 1. So I'll use the trick of having a
dummy entry in the playerscores for the index 0 and rewrite the rest
of the code accordingly. You can't use the turn= 1-turn trick. But at
least the code is easier to write and maintain.


class scoreboard:
    """ Implements a score board for a darts game
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.playerscores = [None,301,301]
        #  turn = 1 or 2 player's turn.    
        self.turn = 1
        self.throws = 0
    def playerscore(self,player):
        if player == 1 or player == 2:
            return(self.playerscores[player])
        else:
            raise NameError('player out of range')
    def playerthrown(self,player,multiplier,number):
        if player != self.turn:
            raise NameError('throw out of turn')
        self.throws = self.throws + 1
        if (self.throws == 3):
            if (self.turn == 1):
                self.turn = 2
            else:
                self.turn = 1
        if multiplier == 'double':
              number = number*2
        elif multiplier == 'triple':
            number = number*3
        self.playerscores[player] -= number


Now all tests pass.

RED
Lets extend the previous test to make sure that we have got the logic
of turns and throws correct.

    def test_three_throws(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-3*(3*5) - 3*20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*20)

So we get an error

    raise NameError('throw out of turn')
NameError: throw out of turn

I'm not sure which line is causing the error. So I'll regroup my
tests. It was a bad idea to combine too many tests in one.

    def test_player_1_plays_first(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()

    def test_three_throws_3(self):

        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*20)


Lets see what happens.

GREEN:
 Well the first two tests pass. It is the third. Looking at the
 code. I've forgot to reset the number of throws.

    def playerthrown(self,player,multiplier,number):
        if player != self.turn:
            raise NameError('throw out of turn')
        self.throws = self.throws + 1
        if (self.throws == 3):
            self.throws = 0
            if (self.turn == 1):
                self.turn = 2
            else:
                self.turn = 1
        if multiplier == 'double':
              number = number*2
        elif multiplier == 'triple':
            number = number*3
        self.playerscores[player] -= number


Well the last test still fails.

  File "/var/folders/rE/rEvVYKXVEFWAJ9IyyNGDqk++42I/-Tmp-/Python3.274950C3C.py", line 57, in test_three_throws_3
AssertionError: 121 != 241

Is the code or the test?  
    def test_three_throws_3(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',5)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)

        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*20)



I've miscalculated the score.
This test is getting a bit complicated. We've tested the scoring
system for  player 1. So lets divide the test up a bit.

    def test_three_throws_3(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*20)

This test still fails.

Why do we get the answer 121? Because it is the right answer. I got
the test wrong.

  def test_three_throws_3(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)

        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*3*20)

RED

Now lets make the test more complicated. Lets see if we can find a
test to make the code break.

    def test_three_throws_4(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*3*20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-3*2*5)
        
    def test_three_throws_5(self):
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',5)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'triple',20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(2),301-3*3*20)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-3*2*5)        
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',18)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),301-3*2*5-18)

Well I'm confident that the scoring code works and the players turn
works. You have to stare at the code and think. TDD means you only
have to think about little things at a time. Remember that passing a
bunch of tests does not mean that your code is bug free, you have to
think if you can move on.


RED
 What happens when you finish a game of darts. The are variations in
 rule sets, but the version I played in the pub is that you must
 finish on exactly 0.  Also you must score every throw. I'm not sure
 what the real rules are. Anyway this is a quick way for player 1 to
 get to 0.

    def test_win(self):
        # Test what happens when we get to zero.
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',19)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',19)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',19)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',3)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',3)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),0)

Well we still have not reached condition red. This test passes. We
have to decide what we want the class to do when a player wins. 
Alternatives:
 Exceptions?
 Special value for the score?

Personally I like using exceptions for non-error conditions, but some
people think this is a bad idea. On some languages exceptions also
have unnecessary extra overhead. So since this scoreboard will
probably be interfaced to a GUI, we'll return a string 'WON' when the
score goes to 0.

So lets modify the last line of the test.
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),'WON')
The test fails.

GREEN
 So lets make the score function return 'WON' if the score is 0.

    def playerscore(self,player):
        if player == 1 or player == 2:
            if (self.playerscores[player] != 0 ): 
                return(self.playerscores[player])
            else:
                return('WON')
        else:
            raise NameError('player out of range')

All test pass.

RED:
 Well if you get a negative score during a throw then your score is
 reset back to what it was before the throw (in some variants you have
 to end on a double as well, we won't bother with that). 
 So we can modify the previous test.

    def test_win_2(self):
        # Test what happens when we get to zero.
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',19)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',19)
        game.playerthrown(1,'double',19)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',3)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        self.assertNotEqual(game.playerscore(1),'WON')
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',1)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',3)
        game.playerthrown(1,'single',3)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),'WON')


Btw. you really should refactor the test cases. I'll leave these to
you.

Run the tests:

So we have to deal with -nve scores and deal with resetting the
score. 

So we'll need to keep track of the score in the current round.

When we flip the current player we'll check if the score is -ve. If it
is then we'll add the current_round score back to the score so the
score should be reset to the score before the round.

        elif multiplier == 'triple':

        self.playerscores[player] -= number
        self.current_round += number



Run the test. The code still does not work.

Lets make the test a little more fine grained. 
 def test_win_2(self):
        # Test what happens when we get to zero.
        game = darts.scoreboard()
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)
        game.playerthrown(1,'triple',20)

        game.playerthrown(2,'single',1)

        game.playerthrown(1,'single',3)
        self.assertEqual(game.playerscore(1),'WON')


It still fails:

So I must of got the logic wrong for incrementing and decrementing the
score. 


I got the current_round logic wrong. Before when I flipped it didn't
affect the rest of the code. Now I have to flip in the right place.



(I cheated I added print statements to see what was going wrong. Old
habits die hard!)

This gives us the following bit of code.

    def playerthrown(self,player,multiplier,number):
        #Check if it the right players turn.
        if player != self.turn:
            raise NameError('throw out of turn')
        #Now it is safe to increment the number of throws.
        self.throws = self.throws + 1
        #If we've down 3 throws then it is somebody else's turn.

        #Now work out the score.
        if multiplier == 'double':
              number = number*2
        elif multiplier == 'triple':
            number = number*3
        #Change the current score.
        self.playerscores[player] -= number
        self.current_round += number
        #If we have done 3 throws then
        # 1) we need to flip
        # 2) we need to our score is -ve.
        # 3) We need to reset the current_score to 0.
        if (self.throws == 3):
            self.throws = 0
            #This if statement flips the players turn.
            if (self.turn == 1):
                self.turn = 2
            else:
                self.turn = 1
            #Now we check if our score is -ve
            if self.playerscores[player] < 0:
                self.playerscores[player] += self.current_round
            #Now reset the current_round
            self.current_round = 0
        #That's the end of the 3 throws logic.

All tests are passed. The code is working. 
The method is kind of long. There is plenty of scope to refactor the
code.
