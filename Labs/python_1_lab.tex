\title{Introduction to Python and its Unit Testing framework}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section*{Instructions}
These are self evaluation exercises. If you know no python, then work through
these exercises and it will prepare yourself for the lab.

If you want help with the exercises then please talk to the lab
assistant.

\section*{Exercise Goals}
There are two goals in this exercise. The first goal is to get a little
experience programming in Python, and the second goal is to learn how
to use Python's unit testing framework. This exercise should be easy and is
designed as preparation for the next lab. If you get stuck you should
look at the Python tutorial at \url{http://docs.python.org/tutorial/}
or at the extensive documentation at \url{http://docs.python.org/}. If
you have had some experience with Python, then this exercise should be very
easy. Hopefully if you have had no experience with Python, then this
exercise will help to get you started for the  lab.
\section*{Note on Python versions}
This code should work with Python 3

\section*{Python Unit Testing Mechanics}
We will split our code up into two files \texttt{code.py} and
\texttt{testcode.py} In your favourite text editor, create the following
skeleton for \texttt{testcode.py}

\begin{lstlisting}
import code
import unittest

class TestCode(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_simple(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.return_zero(),0)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
\end{lstlisting}

and the following for {\tt code.py}

\begin{lstlisting}
  def return_zero():
    return 0
\end{lstlisting}
Note that in Python, \emph{indentations matter}. So for example the {\tt def
  test\_simple(self)} function is a part of the TestCode class \emph{because
  it has a deeper indentation}. Likewise, the {\tt self.assertEqual} test is
part of the {\tt test\_simple} function. In Python, levels of indentations are
used instead of the enclosing brackets you may be used to from many other
languages. Take care to use \emph{either} spaces \emph{or} tabs for
indentations. Never use both in the same file.

Now at the command line, or using your favourite IDE, do
\begin{verbatim}
hamberg> python3 testcode.py
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK

\end{verbatim}
What happened here? We have defined a rather silly function that returns 0. We
assert that the code also returns 0 using the {\tt self.assertEqual} function
in {\tt testcode.py}
  
\section{Task}
Python, like C++ and Java, uses {\tt ==} for comparison. So for
example {1 == 2} is {\tt False} while {1 == 1} is {\tt True}. Rewrite
the above test to use {\tt self.assertTrue}. Note that you need a
version of Python greater than or equal to 2.4 to use {\tt
  assertTrue}. As mentioned above, on the department Unix terminals
you can use the command line:
\begin{verbatim}
hamberg> python3 testcode.py
\end{verbatim}
to invoke the latest installed version of Python 3.

\section*{Functions and arguments}
Python functions can take arguments. For example we can write the
function {\tt double(x)} (insert this into {\tt code.py}):
\begin{lstlisting}
  def double(x):
    return 2*x
\end{lstlisting}
we can then write some unit tests (in {\tt testcode.py}):
\begin{lstlisting}
import code
import unittest

class TestCode(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_simple(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.return_zero(),0)
    def test_double(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.double(2),4)
        self.assertEqual(code.double(4),8)
        self.assertEqual(code.double(0),0)
        self.assertEqual(code.double(-2),-4)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

  \end{lstlisting} and run them as usual with {\tt python3
    testcode.py}. Note that each test function starts with {\tt
    test}. Note again that indentation is important. From now on only
  the new test functions will be given. It is up to you to add them to
  {\tt testcode.py} and make sure that you have the correct
  indentation.

\section{Task}
Now write a new function {\tt triple} in {\tt code.py} and write a
similar set of tests as seen above. You function {\tt triple} should triple
its argument.

\section*{Making Decisions}
Python like any other language has {\tt if} statements. For example
the function:
\begin{lstlisting}
def if1(x):
    if x==0:
        return 'zero'
    if x>0:
        return 'positive'
    if x<0:
        return 'negative'
\end{lstlisting}
returns a string. This can be tested using the following test cases.
\begin{lstlisting}
   def test_if1(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.if1(0),'zero')
        self.assertEqual(code.if1(1),'positive')
        self.assertEqual(code.if1(-1),'negative')
\end{lstlisting}
\section{Task}
Type the code in and run the tests to make sure that it all
works. Python uses {\tt elif} as an abbreviation of {\tt else
  if}. Write a new version of {\tt if1} called {\tt if2} that uses
two {\tt elif} instead of the corresponding {\tt if} statements. You
have to work out which ones you change. It should pass the tests:
\begin{lstlisting}
      def test_if2(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.if2(0),'zero')
        self.assertEqual(code.if2(1),'positive')
        self.assertEqual(code.if2(-1),'negative')
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{For loops}
We met the range statement in the lecture. This rather boring function
just returns the same integer that it is given by a rather roundabout
route.
\begin{lstlisting}
  def loop1(x):
    result = 0
    for n in range(1,x+1):
        result = result + 1
    return(result)
\end{lstlisting}
as witnessed by the test cases:
\begin{lstlisting}
      def test_loop1(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.loop1(0),0)
        self.assertEqual(code.loop1(19),19)
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Task}
Write a function {\tt loop\_sum(x)} which sums the integers 1,2, up to
{\tt x}. It should pass the test cases:
\begin{lstlisting}
   def test_loop_sum(self):
        self.assertEqual(code.loop_sum(0),0)
        self.assertEqual(code.loop_sum(1),1)
        self.assertEqual(code.loop_sum(2),3)
        self.assertEqual(code.loop_sum(100),5050)
\end{lstlisting}
Use a {\tt for} loop!.

\section*{Python Strings}

Python has a rich set of string handling methods (look at
\url{http://docs.python.org/library/string.html}). In your second lab you will
use the method {\tt split}. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
>>> '1,2,3,4'.split(',')
['1', '2', '3', '4']
>>>
\end{verbatim}
To concatenate strings you can use {\tt +}
\begin{verbatim}
>>> 'hello ' + ' goodbye'
'hello  goodbye'
\end{verbatim}
\section{Task}
As you can see {\tt split} returns a list strings. Python has a built
in {\tt join} method. You job is to write your own. It should pass the
tests:
\begin{lstlisting}
   def test_myjoin(self):
        split1 = '1,2,3,4'.split(',')
        self.assertEqual(code.myjoin(split1,','),'1,2,3,4')
        self.assertEqual(
            code.myjoin('Hello and goodbye'.split('and'),'and'),
            'Hello and goodbye')
\end{lstlisting}

The following code will not work:
\begin{lstlisting}
  def myjoin(lst,sep):
    rstring = '' 
    for i in lst:
        rstring = rstring + i + sep
    return rstring
\end{lstlisting}
Run the test and find out. The code nearly works. The loop {\tt for i in l}
iterates over every item in the list. The following hints might help:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a list {\tt lst} to get the list minus the last item use:
  \begin{lstlisting}
     lstminus_last = lst[0:len(lst)-1]
  \end{lstlisting}
\item To access the last item in a list you can use {\tt lst[len(lst)-1]}.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Conclusion}
This exercise has only briefly scratched the surface of Python. Before
the next exercise 
you are strongly encouraged to go through one of the many Python tutorials on
the web.
